        <h1  class="about"  style="margin-top: 0; background-color: white;"> Why yhangry? </h1>
        <h3 >  For class, my group and I had to design a interactive figma for a start-up. Our initial attraction 
            toward yhangry as our start-up was that it had a fun sounding name. Later I learned that yhangry 
            was a company that you could hire private chefs to come and cook for you which I thought was a super cool idea. 
            I also love to cook myself, so I am drawn toward anything that has to do with food.

            <h3> This website walks through how we built our interactive interface for yhangry.
                We wanted to create a website that best conveyed our interpretation of the company's vision.  </h3>

                <h1  class="about"  style="margin-top: 0.5em;background-color: white; "> How was this created? </h1>

                <h1 style="margin-top:0"><u>Sketches: </u> </h1> 
                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
                    We started off by creating quick initial sketches on how we wanted to design the yhangry interactive interface.

                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
                    We then flushed out our ideas and created a wireframe of what we wanted our interactive interface to look like. A wireframe is  
                    a more in depth layout of our design that shows what we want to show up on our website

                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
                    We then created a Figma based off of our wireframe. A Figma is a mockup of a website, that models what we
                    want a website to look like without using any code. After our initial design, we got feedback on our Figma and were 
                    able made changes.

                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
                    After we created the Figma we set up a user testing experiment to see if users 
                    could complete specific tasks we asked them about for our Figma.

                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:1; margin-bottom: 0; color: rgb(192, 73, 73);"> 
                    <u>Task Asked:</u> First, users should use the arrows on the home page to browse through recent meals cooked through yhangry.
                    Users should click on the recent meal 'salmon with brussel sprouts.' This should allow them to then read what chef serves that salmon meal.
                    Next, the user should start their booking process by clicking 'Book Now' in the navbar.
                    Now on the booking page, users must select Indian as cuisine, a party size of 5 people, Halal meal, and the chef Sammy.
                    Once all meal details are chosen, the user should then add this meal to their cart.
                    Next, press confirm. This will take them to a final congratulations page, ending the user test.

                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:1; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
                    <u>Results:</u> Users had difficulty with the first task but were able to easily navigate the other tasks they 
                    were asked to complete.

        <h1  class="about"  style="margin-top: 1; background-color: white;"> What I learned </h1>
            <h3 >  I learned how to take an idea for a company and through what the company does create my own interpretation of what 
                their website would look like.  </h3>    
            <h3 >  I learned how to turn a sketch into a wireframe and then a wireframe into a fully interactable 
                Figma  </h3>  
                <h3 >  I learned the importance of user critiques and user testings. These
                    show flaws and confusing factors in a website that you might not have thought of before. 
                Without the initial critique or the user critique we would not have been able to make the improvements 
            we did, and in the end we had a better product.   </h3>
