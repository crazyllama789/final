        <h3 >  I grew up reading books about animals and was glued to the animal planet. So, I very much love animals.
            My grandfather would also take me to the Roger Williams Zoo when I would come up to the Rhode Island in the summers. So, 
            the inspiration for my website came from the love I have toward animals, and the amazing memories I had at the Roger William Zoo.

            <h3>This website was created to help zookeepers.
                 I designed a website to sort and filter through specific animals and allow zookeepers to purchase them.

                <h3 style="text-align:center;"> 
                    The items allow us to see the price of the animals, the type of food the animal eats, and its location. We can also add and delete from 
                    the item display.

                    The shopping allows us to add and remove animals from our cart. We can see the total cost of all animals and the 
                    indvidual cost of each animal.

                <h3 style="text-align:center;"> 
                    The filter allows us to filter animals based off of location and type of food they eat. We
                    can also sort the animal by price. The example below is showing all animals from Asia.

                    <u>Components: </u> They are the building blocks for react, they allow us to group elements together to make 
                        it easier to interact with these elements

                <h3 style="text-align:center;"> 
                    <u>States: </u> Allow our components to be interactive, allows us to include things like counters

                <h1 style="margin-top:0; font-size: 2em;"><u>How I used components, data, and states: </u></h1> 
                <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size: large;"> 
                    There is a cart component to keep track of the cart, there is a filter component to filter the different animals based off of price, type, and location. 
                    There is the home component to layout the homepage for the animals and the different tiles, and there is the product component that is used to layout each individual animal
                </h3>
                <h3 style="text-align:center;font-size: large;"> 
                    The cart and filter use elements from the products component beach each  individual animals are either added to the cart or sorted. 
                </h3>
                <h3 style="text-align:center;font-size: large;"> 
                    The user can trigger state changes by adding and removing animals from the cart. When a user adds animals to the cart the state representing the total price changes and the list of animals also changes. 
                    It either decreases or increases the price or adds or removes animals.

            <h3 > This website was the first time I used react. I learned what components and states were and how to use them. 
                I also learned to sort and filter items on a react website, and how to add and remove items from a shopping cart in react.  </h3>
